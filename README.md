# **Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning**

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying breast cancer using machine learning algorithms in Python. The dataset used contains labeled data for breast cancer diagnosis, and multiple classification models were evaluated to determine the best-performing algorithm.

## Algorithms Used

The following classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Results

- Best Model: Logistic Regression
- Worst Model: Decision Tree Classifier

The performance of these models was assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
